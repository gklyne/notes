# Graham Klyne: CV at 2014-11-03

I have been a software developer since the mid 1970s.  Over this period, my experience has covered a wide range of technologies and application areas, from minicomputers and early microprocessor systems to modern-day PCs, in applications from real-time process control to high-level information management.  I have contributed to development of technical standards in the IETF, W3C and other forums, and am (co)editor of numerous Internet and Web specifications.  A common strand in all this diversity has been the application of new ideas to existing problems.

My current interests revolve around the application of Semantic Web and linked data technologies, with particular interest in combining them smoothly with pre-existing web software developments.  I am also have experience with Internet protocols, security of network applications, asynchronous-messaging-based distributed systems, and applications of functional programming.

I have worked with a wide range of systems from bare hardware to modern virtualized systems, and languages from low-level assembly and C to high-level functional and logic languages.  I advocate agile software development techniques, by which I mean a flexible, incremental, use-case led approach rather than any specific methodology.  My current tools of choice are Linux/Unix, Python and Django, but this is subject to change according to the problem at hand.

## Experience

### 2014

Currently working on a web-based personal "linked data notebook" project [(Annalist)](https://github.com/gklyne/annalist), and am associated with Oxford University's e-Research Centre [(OeRC)](http://www.oerc.ox.ac.uk).

### 2004-2013: _Image Bioinformatics Research Group, Zoology Department, University of Oxford_

Specializing in Semantic Web and Web software, I led or worked upon a number of different research projects concerned with the management, preservation and publication of research data, including:

* Wf4Ever -  Advanced Workflow Preservation Technologies for Enhanced Science (2011-2013) ([http://www.wf4ever-project.org](), [http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/97462_en.html]())

* Fly-TED - Drosophila testes gene expression image database (2004-2007)

I also participated in some related activities:

* Presented [Oxford XML Summer School](http://xmlsummerschool.com/2013-overview/) course segment on RDF applications: Research Data Management: Dealing with Diversity (2013)

* Presented [Oxford XML Summer School](http://xmlsummerschool.com/2012-overview/) course segment on RDF applications: Millennia of Metadata: Building the CLAROS website of classical art using semantic web technologies (2012)

* JISC [SWORD](http://swordapp.org/about/) V2 project, member of [technical advisory panel](http://swordapp.org/2011/01/sword-technical-advisory-panel/) (2011)

* [Identity, Reference and the Web](http://www2006.org/workshops/#W09), WWW2006 conference workshop - program committee member (2006)

### 2005-2008: _WebBrick Systems Limited_

Working part time with a start-up company to create “embedded web computing” software, for real-time building control, smart home and related applications.

### 2002-2004: _Independent Consultant_

W3C and IETF standards related work, and implementing software in Haskell and Python for my own Semantic Web developments.

Partner in the European 5th Framework iTrust working group, and a member of the program committee for the First, Second and Third International Conferences on Trust Management.  (http://www.ninebynine.org/iTrust/Intro.html)

### 2000-2002: _MIMEsweeper Group_

(Initially part of Content Technologies, purchased by Baltimore Technologies in October 2000, and again by Clearswift Corporation in March 2002.) Investigation and development of new technologies to form the basis of new content management facilities for the [MIMEsweeper](http://www.mimesweeper.com) range of products. I worked with Baltimore's research team in Dublin to propose technical strategies for developing an integrated line of network security products, and championed research into a more robust approach to application security based, in part, on Semantic Web ideas.

### 1997-1999: _5th Generation Messaging_

Created a secure, reliable email-based protocol to support legal admissibility of electronically transferred messages. During this period, I was instrumental in the formation of a new working group within the IETF to address issues of protocol-independent content negotiation.

### 1993-1997: _Integralis Ltd_

Provision of IT network infrastructure technical support and bespoke network software developments to banking and large-companies. Here, I developed an early network address translation (NAT) gateway, based on Slackware Linux, which was deployed in one of the large London commercial banks. I was pivotal in the formation of a software development group within the company, which created the first commercial email virus scanner (MIMEsweeper), and which was eventually spun-off as a separate company (Content Technologies, now Clearswift).

### 1986-1993: _Independent Consultant/Programmer_

I worked on a range of projects including: foreign exchange dealing, real-time data capture, computer aided design of mechanisms.  Before there was such a thing as Microsoft Foundation Classes, I developed a C++ class library to facilitate the programming of the Windows user interface used for the mechanism design product.

### 1980-1986: _Oxford Medical Systems/Oxford Metrics Group_

Developed the mathematics and implemented software for VICON, which used TV cameras to measure and analyze human movement; this was the first commercially available 3-D motion capture system. The company went on to become the leading supplier of motion capture systems to the film and computer games industries (http://www.omgplc.com).

### 1975-1980

Various programming jobs with British Steel Corporation, WS Atkins Group, British Ship Research Association and Plessey, involved with real-time process monitoring and control, tools to support software development for microprocessor systems and computer aided design.

## Standards activities

### Internet Engineering Task Force (1997-present)

[https://www.ietf.org]()

Participated in several IETF working groups, notably Internet fax and content negotiation.  Authored several Internet standard and related specification documents (RFCs - see publications).  I am currently IANA's “designated expert” reviewer for new URI scheme and message header registrations.

### W3C Provenance working group (2011-2013)

[http://www.w3.org/2011/prov/]()

I participated in this as part of my work on workflow preservation (Wf4Ever project), and was co-editor of the Provenance Access and Query specification, and contributed to many of the other working group documents.

### NISO/Open Archives Initiative Resource Synchronization (2012-2014)

[http://www.niso.org/workrooms/resourcesync/]()

Now published as ANSI/NISO Z39.99-2014.  Drawing on my real-time software experience, I made a number of significant contributions to the design of time-dependent elements of the protocol.

### W3C RDFcore working group (2001-2004)

[http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/]()

RDF is the base language for Semantic Web data.  I was co-editor of the RDF concepts document which is part of the W3C Recommendation suite for RDF.

### W3C CC/PP working group (1999-2002)

CC/PP was the first W3C Recommendation to be based entirely on RDF.  During my time with the working group, I was lead editor of the [CC/PP Structure and Vocabularies](http://www.w3.org/TR/CCPP-struct-vocab/) specification.
