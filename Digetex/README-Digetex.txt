Photos of Alesund for Digetex roller blind.

Blind recess dimensions: 1865x945mm

(Size of blind to be reduced as needed to fit recess, with operating
cord on the left when looking out of the window. NOTE: there is a
very narrow window frame - about 10mm - to overlap on right when
looking out of the window.)

Images on this CD are resampled at 150dpi and 180dpi to be slightly
larger than the recess, on the assumption that they will be centred
on the visible area of the blind when lowered and will be printed
right up to the edge of the finished blind material.

"Superdrive".
