# Kit for disposal

Free to a good home, no warranties, etc.  Quite a bit is functional, some not but may be useful for hacks.


## Tools etc

- "performance power" (B&Q brand) hammer drill, in plastic case with charger *Request: David O (for one or other drill)*
- "performance power" (B&Q brand) non-hammer drill and circular saw with TCT blade, in plastic case with charger  *Requests: Jared R (for saw)*
- 6 battery packs for above, but 2-3 have weak cells and could use replacements.
- conference phone - old US Robotics "3-legged" model

I'm still waiting for word if OxHack wants any of these.


## Networking equipment

- Netgear RO318 "security router".  Could be used as 8-port 10/100M ethernet hub
- Netgear RT338 ISDN router
- 3-COM Officeconnect 8-port dual speed (10/100) ethernet switch
- old-style ethernet tranceivers (15-pin 802.3 ethernet to coax (10base2) or TP (10baseT))
- 16-port 10/100 ethernet switch; internal power supply
- **NEW** Netgear DG834G v3 4-port Ethernet/Wifi/ADSL router (useful for EMG village, for local WIFI?)

I'm waiting to hear if the OxHack, or anyone, is interested in any of these.


## Electronics and computer components

- Old tower server (based on early dual Athlon processors).  Various peripherals.
- Various memory modules
  - 240 pin, 1Gb, PC2, 5300, I think they're unbuffered.
  - 168 pin, 256Mb, PC133
  - 168 pin, 512Mb, PC133, Crucial branded
  - 2Gb204 SODIMM DDR3 PC3 8500 modules (ex laptop memory)
  - several other older modules, typically 256Mb
- DELL 17" flat screen monitor (VGA only) *Request: Tek M*
- Belkin VGA+PS2 4-way KVM switch, with cables
- various keyboards; mostly USB and PS2 connectors, but at least one logitech wireless *Request: David O*
- cables
  - lots of RS232 D-connectors (25- and 9-way)
  - some VGA video
  - some old SCSI cables
  - Belkin USB "dockstation" (provides serial, parallel, PS2 keyboard/mouse connections via host USB port)
- various power cords
- old-style mac display connector to HDMI
- Mobile phone external aerial
- mini maglite (2*&AA size) body, spare bulbs and KLED conversion kit.  Internal bulb socket is missing, so not working.  Hackable?

Taken:

- Nokia 770 "Internet tablet" (early generation Linux stylus tablet).  *This has been left at OxHack*
- various RC servos (~5V supply, driven by 1-2ms pulse width)  Some new, some used.  *These have been left at OxHack;  if anyone wants more I can probably find some*


## Photographic

*Request: Jane C*

- Patterson film developing tank for 2x35mm or 1x larger film
  - (I used to use this for B/W and Ektrachrome colour processing)
- film drying clips and squeegee

## Audio, toys, etc

- Luxman T110 FM (only) tuner

Taken:

- Keyence "Engager GS III" E770,  early generation quad copter in need of some repairs.  Some spares included.  Includes 40MHz transmitter.  This is an old model, purchased in Japan, that uses conventional motors.  I don't know if the electronics are hackable.  *This has been left at OxHack with Jared;  Jared: I also have two original batteries (6-cell NiCad) and charge cable to bring in for you.*
